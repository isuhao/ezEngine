#cmake

#
# This is a cmake file that helps to mirror the file structure on disk in Visual Studio.
# This file is identical for all folders in all libraries. By copying it into a folder of a library,
# all files in that folder will automatically be added to the build solution (you might need to re-run cmake though).
#
# *** Do not modify this file. ***

# Get the name of this folder
