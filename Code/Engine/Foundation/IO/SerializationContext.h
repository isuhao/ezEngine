/// \brief A serialization context is used to (de-)serialize special types that require more complex logic than just moving a few bytes.
///
/// A serialization context can, for example, be used to keep track of which objects have already been serialized into a stream,
/// such that when they are written a second time to the stream, only a reference to the first one is actually stored.
/// Upon deserialization the context of course needs to resolve these references properly.
///
/// In general a serialization context only provides additional 'state' per stream and for a specific set of types. There can be any
/// number of serialization contexts active for the same stream, they are basically 'tacked on' from the outside, the stream itself
/// knows nothing of serialization contexts.
///
/// A serialization context is created by deriving from ezSerializationContext, passing the own class as the template argument.
///
/// In the derived class you have to implement two functions per type that the context is supposed to handle:\n
///   (virtual) void Read (ezStreamReader& stream, TYPE& type)\n
///   (virtual) void Write(ezStreamWriter& stream, const TYPE& type)\n
///
/// The macro EZ_ADD_SERIALIZATION_CONTEXT_OPERATORS() will then add the << and >> operators that redirect serialization of that type
/// to these Read/Write functions.
///
/// In these functions you can implement whatever complex logic is necessary to (de-)serialize the type and you can keep custom state.
///
/// When serializing to or from some stream, you need to create an instance of your serialization context and associate it with the
/// reader / writer stream. This should be done by the derived class implementation by calling RegisterReaderStream() and
/// RegisterWriterStream(). Once that is done, the static functions GetReaderContext() and GetWriterContext() give access to the
/// serialization context that is associated with a given stream. For details how this can be used, see the code in the 
/// EZ_ADD_SERIALIZATION_CONTEXT_OPERATORS() macro.
