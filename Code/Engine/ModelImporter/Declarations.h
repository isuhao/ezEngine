  /// Depending on the model format and the use by the artist, there may be different semantic specifier for the same property/texture or the same specifier for different properties.
  /// To make it easier to work with different formats, an importer implementation can try to map a input semantic to a predefined semantic.
  /// However, since a clear mapping is usually not possible or might lead to data loss we keep the original semantic as a string.
  ///
  /// For example one file format may specify a color with the semantic "diff" and another with "color".
  /// It is reasonable for a importer implementation to map both semantics to a DIFFUSE to make further processing easier.
  ///
  /// Note that most, but not all semantic hints are applicable for both textures and properties.
