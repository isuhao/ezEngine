How to use CMake {#HowToUseCMake}
================

  * Download CMake from [www.cmake.org](http://www.cmake.org) and install it.

  * Run the CMake GUI.

  * For "Where is the source code" select the ezEngine "Trunk" directory.

  * For "Where to build the binaries" select an empty folder, where you want the solution to end up in, for example "Trunk/Workspace", but it can also be somewhere completely different (e.g. another hard drive even).

  * Click "Configure" once.

  * A lot of red should appear (newly found configuration variables). The default values should work fine. Later you can check out what configuration options there are.

  * Click "Configure" again. Now the build will be configured with the settings that you have selected (ie. default values).
    * If still more red stuff appears, that means during the second run more configuration variables were found (probably because you modified something).
    * Just click "Configure" until no red stuff is there anymore.

  * Now click "Generate" -> The solution will be generated in the folder that you specified.

  * Open up the solution, compile and have fun.


Re-run CMake (ie. press "Configure" and "Generate") everytime changes have been done, that are not automatically detected (e.g. you added a file to a folder) -> Visual Studio will detect outside changes and reload the project.


Using ezEngine with Custom CMake Based Applications
---------------------------------------------------

In "Code\BuildSystem\CMake" you can find the file "FindezEngine.cmake" which makes it easier to integrate ezEngine into a project that already uses CMake.

Further usage details are given inside that file.
